Multiplayer Chess V1.0 is based on OCC by Michael Speck at http://lgames.sourceforge.net/index.php?project=OCC.

The original OCC files included in this package as 'occ-1.3.2.tar.gz'.

Lots of modifications been made to turn the original script into database driven application. It is a massive multiplayer chess where you can play with unlimited number of opponents, not in real time but rather works like the classic correspondence chess.

To install:--
open the file "db_config.inc.php" and enter your database account details. Then run install.php. If you see the index page, then it is DONE!

Try open 2 different browsers, and create 2 accounts and play against yourself.
